Petition API is part of the DDDC.

Digital Democracy and Data Commons is a pilot participatory process oriented to test a new technology to improve the 
digital democracy platform Decidim and to collectively imagine the data politics of the future.

This pilot takes place in the context of the European project 
[DECODE (Decentralized Citizen Owned Data Ecosystem)](https://decodeproject.eu) that aims to construct legal, 
technological, and socioeconomic tools that allow citizens to take back control over their data and 
[technological sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvBRbwBm_nQ).
 
Our effort is that of improving people's awareness of how their data is processed by algorithms, as well facilitate the
work of developers to create along
[privacy by design principles](https://decodeproject.eu/publications/privacy-design-strategies-decode-architecture) 
using algorithms that can be deployed in any situation without any change.

## :rocket: Getting started

> This requires docker to be installed


```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/DECODEproject/dddc-petition-api.git
cd dddc-petition-api
./start.sh
```

This will clone the project and all submodules of the project (**--recursive** is important)
then by lunching the `start.sh` will create a docker container with all the dependencies correctly
configured.

Head your browser to:

**SWAGGER UI**: http://0.0.0.0/docs/

**API**: http://0.0.0.0/ 

***
## :floppy_disk: Install

To locally run you need to run over a the API project over an [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) server 
like [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/).

Assuming you are already cloned the project as described on [Getting started](#rocket_getting-started) with the 
submodules and already `cd` into your project directory `dddc-petition-api` you need the following steps

1. create a `virtualenv`
1. activate the virtualenv
1. upgrade the pip
1. install dependencies
1. install the ASGI server
1. run locally the API

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
pip install uvicorn
uvicorn app.main:api --log-level debug --reload
```


***
## :video_game: Usage

This API server is meant for the Petition of the DDDC Project part of the DECODE project.

***
## :whale: Docker

```bash
docker build -t dddc-petition-api .
docker run --rm -p 80:80 -e APP_MODULE="app.main:api" -e LOG_LEVEL="debug" -it dddc-petition-api
```

All the options are documented on [here](https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-docker#advanced-usage)

***
## :honeybee: API

All the parameters and format of the input are documented on the swagger, below you'll find a quick description of each
endpoint 


#### /
Hello world endpoint

***
## :wrench: Configuration

```bash
export DEBUG=true
export ROOT_SRC=${HOME}/src/dddc-petition-api

export DB_URL=sqlite:///${ROOT_SRC}/db.sqlite3

export JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
export JWT_TOKEN_SUBJECT=access
export JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
export JWT_USERNAME=***
export JWT_PASSWORD=***
export JWT_RANDOM_SECRET=***

export CONTRACTS_DIR=${ROOT_SRC}/app/contracts/src/

export CREDENTIAL_ISSUER_USERNAME=***
export CREDENTIAL_ISSUER_PASSWORD=***
export CREDENTIAL_ISSUER_CREDENTIALS_DIR=${ROOT_SRC}/app/credentials/

export PETITION_CONTROL_TOKEN=***
```

### Credentials folder
The credential folder contains credential previously created from the credential issuer and are store in file per `sha256(credential_issuer_id)` and the following three things are stored:

 * the credential object (output of 06-CITIZEN-aggregate-credential-signature.zencode) in form of filename **HEX**
 * the verifier keys of the credential issuer (04-CREDENTIAL_ISSUER-publish-verifier.zencode) **HEX.verify**
 * the private petition-api keys (01-CITIZEN-credential-keygen.zencode) **HEX.keys**
 
 Eg. if the `CREDENTIAL_ISSUER_CREDENTIALS_DIR=${ROOT_SRC}/app/credentials/` and the `credential_issuer_uid='issuer_identifier'` like https://petitions.decodeproject.eu/uid then the folder /app/credentials contains the following files:
 
 ```
3b2332e905bd662448d7114d0626421b82deb33fcf3bafe3c284bdfb9f58e2c6
3b2332e905bd662448d7114d0626421b82deb33fcf3bafe3c284bdfb9f58e2c6.keys
3b2332e905bd662448d7114d0626421b82deb33fcf3bafe3c284bdfb9f58e2c6.verify
 ```


***
## :clipboard: Testing

```bash
python3 setup.py test
```

***
## :bug: Troubleshooting & debugging

To run the `petition-api` in debug mode, please run it in local and activate `--debug` when you launch the ASGI
uvicorn server. 

Set the `LOG_LEVEL="debug"` ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE that is used by `uvicorn` and `starlette`.
